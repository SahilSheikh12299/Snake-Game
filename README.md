# Snake-Game
## Screenshots of the game can be found in the game directory, under the names "Gameplay.png" and "Game over.png".
Python Code for the famous "Snake" game that we all know about using PyGame module.
Working of the game:
Game starts with a single block moving in the downwardsdirection. The direction of the block can be controlled by the arrow keys on our keyboard.
In the game, an apple is drawn at random positions. If the block strikes the apple, the block grows in size, there's a score tab on the top rightcorner of our game,
which is nothing but the size of the snake.
The game can end under two conditions, if it hits the boundaries of our game window, or, if it strikes it's own body.
After the game is over, the display is updated with the final score, and the player is prompted to replay the game using the "RETURN" key, or to quit the game using the "ESC" key.
